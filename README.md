- 🌱 I’m currently doing my MPhil in Computer Science, Computer Graphics specifically. Before that, I got my B.E from Sun Yat-sen University in China.
  
- 🧠 There has been a lot of stereotypes towards Chinese STEM students, but I hate to be perceived as a tech nerd. "By expressing yourself, you come to life." I believe coding should be my tool of expressing.
     
- 💬 Before I decided to dive into [cg reseach](https://hoytxu.me/cg-research-map/), I spent a lot of my time in studying GenAI. Including several ML, CV courses, a summer exchange to NUS, and even an internship.
